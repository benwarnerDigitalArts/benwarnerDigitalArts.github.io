## Project 1: Model a Real World Object - King Kittan figure
### Date: September 23rd, 2020

### Objective:
Identify a basic object such as a car, animal, or figure to model.

### Solution:
#### I chose to model a small figure of King Kittan from the anime show Gurren Lagann!

#### My primary method was to focus on roughly fitting primitives to the front and side views of the object with basic manipulations. A transparent mode was used to ensure a good fit. I also focused on only modeling one side of the model, creating a central line to mirror it about to create perfect symmetry.

#### For enhanced realism, I applied a Blinn material and sampled the colors directly from the images.  Here, you can also see the approximate postions of the image planes that were used.

#### Careful attention was given to ensuring that no "N-gons" were used and that triangles were minimized. For hard lines and to reduce model complexity, the fewest lines possible were used.
