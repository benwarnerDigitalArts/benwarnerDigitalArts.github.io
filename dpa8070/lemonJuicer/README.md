## Exercise 3: Lemon Squeezer modeling
### Date: September 2nd, 2020

### Objective:
Only using a picture of a lemon squeezer, recreate the object in Maya using a variety of modeling tools.

### Solution:
Using patented eyeball scanners imbedded in my face, a model for a lemon squeezer was generated.  Form is similar and function is virtual, meaning this model is virtually similar.  Behold.

### Step 1: Create the primitive with sufficient divisions to create all of the necessary features.

### Step 2: Hollow out the cylinder by selecting edges and manipulating them into approximate positions.

### Step 3: Form the central juicer area with more edge or vertex manipulations, then select every other edge to move inward to create the ridges.

### Step 4: Make the bottom edge by inserting edge loops and moving them inwards.

### Step 5: Select points on one edge then manipulate out and down until a pour spout is formed.
