## Project 1: Recreate a Shoe using NURBS!
### Date: September 28th, 2020

### Objective:
From a single image, recreate a shoe using only (or mostly) NURBS and related tools.

### Solution:
#### This shoe is primarily composed of birail #1 surfaces that are then extruded to create a form.  Most notably, the spike of the shoe is created by lofting multiple circles together.

#### For the base of the shoe, the 2 "rails" of the birail were made by using 1 line that was then mirrored over the Z axis.  The large straps and heel area were also mirrored over the Z axis to maintain symmetry, but one strap required slight adjustment afterwards to show as below the other one.

#### The back of the heel area was given a split because a zipper should be right there, but it's difficult to see in the reference.
