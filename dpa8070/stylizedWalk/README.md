## Exercise 13: Stylizd Walk Cycle - "Eternal Trudgement"
### Date: November 4th, 2020

### Objective:
#### Create one alteration of a walkcycle with some stylized movement.  E.g: happy, sad, angry, ferful, nervous, rushed...

### Solution:
#### I decided to try animating a heavy walk with a feeling of exhaustion by bending the character down slightly and making the steps seem more weighted.  In total, this was done with 12 keyframes as can be seen below. Like some sort of cruel fate, this character was judged to trudge for eternity... So, I call this piece "Eternal Trudgement".

#### Additionally, I decided to add a basic cyclinder model to make it seem as though the character were walking on a wheel endlessly. This also serves to better convey the sense of futility. Due to some mysterious unoptimization, this animation became a pretty good personification of what my processor went through during rendering.
