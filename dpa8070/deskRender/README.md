## Exercise 4: Computer Desk Rendering
### Date: September 9th, 2020

### Objective:
Given a single reference image, recreate a computer desk with box modeling techniques as closely as possible.

### Solution:
To begin, I created a cube and deformed it with basic scale manipulations and then proceeded to subdivide until there was enough geometry to create the top of the desk.

From there, I began inserting edge loops as needed while planning out how I would extrude the rest of the features. At that point, I began extruding the main form of the drawers, then created recessions for them, and finally pulled out the legs.

Now, I came to a point where I could go about maintaininng symmetry a couple of different ways. I chose to do this by focusing on 1 half of the desk, then cut it in half and did a mirror operation about Z. The results were pretty favorable.

Finally, I decided to model the drawers and knobs seperately to create the best impression of reality and add some sort of functionality to this model.  The drawers were all made very similarly with box modeling from a cube primitive, but the knobs were mde from cylinders and toruses.

Phong shading and a few light sources were added to create the final result, mimicking the reflectance in the reference.
